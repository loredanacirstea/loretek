## Projects
### IT Software

#### Sapiens Mapping Project|{"text":"Volunteer-based medical project. My contribution consisted of English presentations to professors and volunteers, creation of controlled medical vocabularies, Romanian translation for FIPAT terminologies and other medical terms, database and site maintenance, documentation and video demonstrations.", "start":"2012-09-02", "images":[{"title":"Navigator 2D","url":"http://loretek/images/projects/nav2Dwhite.png"}], "url":"http://sliced.ro/blog", "status":"ongoing", "version":"1.1", "languages":["MySQL","PHP","Javascript"]}

##### Terminologia Histologica App|{"text":"The app has browsing and searching capabilities for the Terminologia Histologica terms. Done in Titanium (Javascript), for the Sapiens Mapping Project. Unofficial Romanian translation by Loretek", "images":[{"title":"Terminologia Histologica App", "url":"http://loretek/images/projects/TH.png"}], "url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/terminologia-histologica/id729055746?mt=8", "version":"1.0", "platform":"Titanium", "languages":["Javascript"]}

##### Terminologia Embryologica App|{"text":"The app has browsing and searching capabilities for the Terminologia Embryologica terms. Done in Titanium (Javascript), for the Sapiens Mapping Project", "images":[{"title":"Terminologia Embryologica App", "url":"http://loretek/images/projects/TE.png"}], "url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/terminologia-embryologica/id729055535?mt=8", "version":"1.0", "platform":"Titanium", "languages":["Javascript"]}

#### Subject|{"text":"Subject is an implementation of the Semantic Web. However, it tries to make things simple to understand and use. Unifying the Web is a universal issue and tools used for this purpose should be easily used by anyone. This is an umbrella project.", "status":"ongoing", "version":"0.3"}

##### SubjectR|{"text":"The SubjectR is an R package that brings the ontologies at the fingertips of data researchers and offers a way to standardize data labeling. Along with the emergence of R servers (see OpenCPU), R data is ready to be crowdsourced and indexed on official ontologies.", "status":"ongoing", "version":"0.3", "languages":["R language"]}

###### Algorithm of translation in the Romanian language for the Terminologia Histologica and APIs for a controlled vocabulary|{"text":"My graduation thesis for the Faculty of Medicine included this preliminary research project for SubjectR. The thesis tackles Semantic Web and Open Data concepts in Medicine. The project offers browsing and data handling options for any terminology, as well as an algorithm for creating a computable translation in a new language for the terms.", "repository":"https://github.com/loredanacirstea/thRoTrans", "start":"2013-01-20", "stop":"2014-09-20", "images":[{"title":"Text parsing efficiency", "url":"http://loretek/images/projects/plot.png"}], "status":"finished", "languages":["R language"]}

##### SubjectRaw|{"text":"SubjectRaw is thought as an interface between ontology creators and the actual users who want to index, organize and link their data. It provides tools for integrating semantic content into the Web.", "repository":"https://github.com/loredanacirstea/subjectrawl", "url":"http://subjectraw.meteor.com", "images":[{"title":"Choosing the ontology","url":"http://loretek/images/projects/subjectrawl_onto.png"},{"title":"Ontology tree", "url":"http://loretek/images/projects/subjectrawl_tree.png"},{"title":"Ontology tree","url": "http://loretek/images/projects/subjectrawl_tree2.png"}, {"title":"Semantic Tools Page", "url":"http://loretek/images/projects/subjectrawl_tools.png"}], "status":"ongoing", "version":"0.3", "languages":["Javascript"], "frameworks":["Semantic UI"], "platform":"Meteor"}

#### The Sapiens Presentation|{"text": "This is a demo for an SVG and Javascript based website. My contribution: SVG image creation and editing. This is part of a volunteering project.", "url": "http://thesapiens.ro/", "images":[{"title":"The Sapiens", "url":"http://loretek/images/projects/thesapiens.png"}], "languages":["SVG"]}

#### ComicStrip|{"text":"PHP project done for attesting my qualifications as a computer operator and intermediary level programmer. It has a very easy user interface for creating comic strips by choosing a picture through a URL, introducing text and choosing two points (left click) for positioning the speech bubble. It also has options for data handling - insert, update, delete, browse.", "repository":"http://sourceforge.net/projects/cstrip/","languages":["PHP","MySQL"], "libraries":["Smarty"]}

## Activites
### Emergency Medicine Volunteer|{"text":"I have developed an ability to work with a team, under stress and with urgent deadlines. I have completed 580 hours of volunteering, part of a program initiated by SMURD (emergency rescue service), with the help of the Medical Students Society in Bucharest.", "start":"2011-09-01", "stop":"2014-08-31","institution":"SMURD - Mobile Emergency Service for Resuscitation and Extrication", "images":{"title":"Medical Volunteer", "url":"http://loretek/images/hobbies/medical_volunteer.jpg"}}
